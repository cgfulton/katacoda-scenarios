This section will give a brief overview of the [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/).

The learner is expected to have a basic understanding of the *Openshift*. 

MLflow is an open source platform to manage the ML lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, deployment, and a central model registry.
- [MLflow Tracking](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/tracking.html#tracking), track experiments to record and compare parameters and results.
- [MLflow Projects](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/projects.html#projects), package ML code in a reusable, reproducible form in order to share with other data scientists or transfer to production.
- [MLflow Models](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#models), manage and deploy models from a variety of ML libraries to a variety of model serving and inference platforms.
- [MLflow Model Registry](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/model-registry.html#registry) provides a central model store to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model, including model versioning, stage transitions, and annotations.

Once, you understand MLflow basics, components and installation please take time to explore various features of MLflow on Openshift.

Now, let's start!
